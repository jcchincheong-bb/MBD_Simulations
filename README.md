# Planar Multibody Dynamics Simulations
A general purpose simulator for the kinematics and dynamics of two dimensional multibody systems. 

Heavily inspired by the work of Javad N. Nikravesh, **Planar Multibody Dynamics**. I started it as part of a course on multibody dynamics in my university Hoschule Rhein-Waal, but I have since continuously improved it. Unlike Nikravhesh, this project uses the MATLAB symbolic toolbox to generalise formulations and also increases the accuracy of calculations at a marginal decrease in speed. 

## Current Content
- Essential functions for dynamics using body coordinate formulation (see Functions folder)
- General purpose scripts to simulate multibody systems using body coordinate formulation (see BC_Formulation folder)\
- Two example mechanisms from the text by Nikravesh.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Symbolic Math Toolbox (optional, for symbolic derivations)
## Future Work
- I am working to implement kinetic analyses like forward and reverse dynamics
