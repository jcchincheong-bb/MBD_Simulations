# Planar Multibody Dynamics Simulations
A general purpose simulator for the kinematics and dynamics of two dimensional multibody systems. 

Heavily inspired by the work of Javad N. Nikravesh, **Planar Multibody Dynamics**. I started it as part of a course on multibody dynamics in my university Hoschule Rhein-Waal, but I have since continuously improved it.

## Current Content

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Symbolic Math Toolbox (optional, for symbolic derivations)
